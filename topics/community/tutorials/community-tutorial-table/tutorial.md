Similarly to the numerous tools available on Galaxy, the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) includes numerous tutorials. This tutorial will take you through the steps to generate resources listing all the relevant tutorials and display the tutorial table on your community codex page.

The pipeline creates a table with all the tutorials. This table can be **filtered to only include tutorials that are relevant to a specific research community**.

The generated community-specific table can be used as is (e.g. downloadable tsv file) and/or embedded (e.g. into a Galaxy Hub page or Galaxy subdomain). 

The pipeline is **fully automated** and executed on a **weekly** basis. Any research community can apply the pipeline to create a table specific to their community.

The aim of this tutorial is to create a tutorial table for a community.

# Add your community to the Galaxy CoDex

You first need to check if your Community is in the [Galaxy CoDex](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/tree/main/communities), a central resource for Galaxy communities.
If the community is already there, you can move to the next step of this tutorial.

If you community is not already included, follow this step :
> <hands-on-title>Add your community to the Galaxy CoDex</hands-on-title>
>
> You need to create a new folder in the data/community folder within Galaxy CoDex code source.
> 1. If not already done, fork the [Galaxy Codex repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex)
> 2. Go to the `communities` folder
> 3. Click on **Add file** in the drop-down menu at the top
> 4. Select **Create a new file**
> 5. Fill in the `Name of your file` field with:  name of your community + `/metadata/tutorial_tags`
>    This will create a folder for your community, a new folder for your community called metadata and a file called tutorial_tags.
> 6. Click on **Commit changes**
> 7. Fill in the commit message with something like `Add X community`
> 8. Click on `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`
> 9. Create the pull request by following the instructions
>
{: .hands_on}

# Pull list of tags relevant to your community

To add tutorials in your community tutorial table, you will need to indicate a list of tags relevant to your community, and tutorials associated with this tag will be automatically pulled from the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) one a week. Only tutorials with the selected tags will be added to the filtered table.
You will then be able to remove tutorials that are not relevant to your community or deprecated.

> <hands-on-title>Select tutorials tags from the Galaxy Training Network</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Go to the [Galaxy Training Network]({% link index.md %})
> 2. Browse for tutorials that are relevant to your community
> 3. Note the tags that are associated with tutorials of interest
{: .hands_on}
> <comment-title>Tips</comment-title>
> You can also create a tag (for example, your community name) and tag all relevant tutorials with it. Then, you only need to use this tag to pull all the relevant tutorials.
{: .comment}

# Add the list relevant tags for your community in the `tutorial_tags` file

> <hands-on-title>Add the relevant tags to the tutorial_tags file</hands-on-title>
> 1. Open or create a file named `tutorial_tags` in your community metadata folder (`communities/<your community>/metadata/tutorial_tags`)
> 2. Add the name of the tags relevant to your community in the `tutorial_tags` file, with 1 tag per row
> (See above for how to identify the appropriate tags)
>
>    For example:
>    ```
>    Assembly
>    Metagenomics
>    ```
{: .hands_on}

Once you have a list of the tags that you wish to keep, you can submit this to Galaxy CoDex.

> <hands-on-title>Submit the new list of tags to Galaxy CoDex</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Click on **Commit changes** at the top
> 2. Fill in the commit message with something like `Add tutorials tags for my community`
> 3. Click on `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`
> 4. Create the pull request by following the instructions
{: .hands_on}

The Pull Request will be reviewed. Make sure to respond to any feedback.

On the sunday following the Pull Request merge, a table with all tutorial will be created in `communities/<your community>/resources/tutorials.tsv`

Here is an overview of the files :

| Filename | Location | Generation | Function | Format | Example (microgalaxy) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| tutorial_tags | communities/<your_community>/metadata/ | Manual | Name of the tags relevant to your community, with 1 tag per row | NA | [Example](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/blob/main/communities/microgalaxy/metadata/tutorial_tags) |
| tutorials.tsv | communities/<your community>/resources/ | Automatic | Table with all the tutorials relevant to your community | TSV | [Example](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/blob/main/communities/microgalaxy/metadata/tutorials.tsv) |
| tutorials.html | communities/<your_community>/resources/ | Automatic | A list of the tutorials in html format to include in a website | HTML | [Example](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/blob/main/communities/microgalaxy/resources/tutorials.html) |

# Embed the table in your community page on the Hub

The table you have created can be embedded in your community page on the Hub, e.g. [microGalaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/microbial/#workflows-and-tutorials).

> <hands-on-title>Embed your table</hands-on-title>
>
> 1.  If not already done, fork the repository [Galaxy Hub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub)
> 2. Open or create your community page: `content/community/sig/<your community>/index.md`
> 3. TO DO : We Will soon update this section to explain how to include the table, sorry for the inconvenience. 
> 4. Submit the changes
> 5. Wait for the Pull Request to be merged

# Conclusion

You now have a table with tutorials available for your community, and this table is embedded in a community page.
