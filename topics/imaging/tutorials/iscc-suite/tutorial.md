# File content and integrity validation with International Standard Content Code (ISCC)

In scientific workflows, ensuring data integrity and tracking modifications of the data content is crucial for reproducibility. Traditional checksums (like MD5 or SHA) can verify if files are identical, but they cannot detect similar content or survive format conversions.

The **International Standard Content Code (ISCC)** is a content-derived identifier that provides both:
- **Identity verification**: Checksum functionality to verify exact file matches
- **Similarity detection**: Ability to detect similar content even across different file formats

The **Galaxy ISCC-suite** allows you to integrate content tracking into any Galaxy workflow, providing quality control and provenance tracking for your data analysis pipelines.

## ISCC Code structure

An ISCC-SUM code is a 55-character identifier with two main components, which are combined into one code:

- **Data-Code**: Content-based hash that allows similarity comparison
- **Instance-Code**: A fast checksum or cryptographic hash

The Instance-Code uses BLAKE3 hashing, truncated to 64 bits by default. For applications requiring cryptographic-strength verification, ISCC-SUM can output the full 256-bit hash.

For example, the ISCC hash for this file [`example_image.tiff`](workflows/test-data/example_image.tiff) is:
```
ISCC:K4AI45QGX6J3LYNEHONZMQT2GJ6YPJDS74EIC2YMSORF4S5H5SKHQQI
```
This ISCC-CODE is built from two individual components — a **Data-Code** and an **Instance-Code**:
```
    ISCC:GADY45QGX6J3LYNEHONZMQT2GJ6YPZ4BXJQ7ZHWZ7EHRLKANDCSACWI  (Data-Code)
    ISCC:IAD2I4X7BCAWWDETUJPEXJ7MSR4EDZCTTBQS6LQQDWDHS6T4KDDPZ5A  (Instance-Code)
```
You might notice that the combined ISCC-CODE (`K4AI...`) looks completely different from these two components. That is expected: the ISCC algorithm takes shortened versions of both hashes, packs them together, and encodes the result as a new string. Think of it like combining two barcodes into a single, shorter barcode — the information is still there, just represented differently.

Files with similar content will have similar Data-Code components, but their Instance-Code will be different. Hence the Instance-Code allows to verify file integrity.

# Prepare your data

For this tutorial, we'll use a simple dataset with microscope images that demonstrate different use cases. However, the ISCC SUM tools can ben used for any type of digital content.

# Generate ISCC codes

The first step is generating ISCC codes for your input files. This creates a content fingerprint that can be used for later content-based identification of the file (e.g., within your workflow or within a publication).

> <hands-on-title>Generate ISCC codes for input files</hands-on-title>

> 1. {% tool [Generate ISCC-CODE](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/imgteam/iscc_sum/iscc_sum/0.1.0+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input File"*: Select the first example image (`example_image.tiff`.)
>  
>    Run the tool. This will generate a 55-character ISCC code for the file.

> 3. Click on the {% icon details %} icon.
>
> 4. Scroll down to the **Job Information** section to view the "Tool Standard Output" log. You should see a single line containing the ISCC code in the output. For the first example image the code is expected to be:
> ```

# Verify file integrity

During workflow execution, you may want to verify that intermediate files match expected content. The **Verify ISCC hash** tool allows you to check if a file matches a known ISCC code.

## Manual verification

> <hands-on-title>Verify a file against its ISCC code</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Verify ISCC-CODE](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/imgteam/iscc_sum_verify/iscc_sum_verify/0.1.0+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Dataset to verify"*: Select the first example image
>    - *"Expected ISCC-CODE"*: 
>        - *"Expected ISCC code"*: Paste the ISCC code you generated in the previous step
>
> 2. Check the output, which contains a verification report that looks like this:
> ```
> OK - ISCC-CODEs match
> Expected:  K4AI45QGX6J3LYNEHONZMQT2GJ6YPJDS74EIC2YMSORF4S5H5SKHQQI
> Generated: K4AI45QGX6J3LYNEHONZMQT2GJ6YPJDS74EIC2YMSORF4S5H5SKHQQI
> ```
>    The report shows:
>    - Status: OK (match) or FAILED (mismatch)
>    - Expected ISCC code
>    - Generated ISCC code
{: .hands_on}

## Workflow integration

A powerful use case is integrating ISCC verification directly into your workflows. Here we'll build a simple verification workflow step by step.

### Step 1 - Define the workflow inputs

To make the workflow reusable, we need to define two inputs: the image to verify and a file containing the expected ISCC code.

> <hands-on-title>Create the workflow inputs</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new workflow in the workflow editor.
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_create_new.md %}
>
> 2. Select {% icon tool %} **Input dataset** from the list of tools:
>    - {% icon param-file %} **1: Input Dataset** appears in your workflow.
>    Change the "Label" of this input to *Input image*.
> 3. Add another {% icon tool %} **Input dataset**:
>    - {% icon param-file %} **2: Input Dataset** appears in your workflow.
>    Change the "Label" of this input to *Expected ISCC code file*.
{: .hands_on}

### Step 2 - Parse the expected ISCC code

The *Generate ISCC-CODE* tool outputs the ISCC code as a text file, but the *Verify ISCC-CODE* tool expects the code as a parameter input. We use *Parse parameter value* to bridge this gap.

> <hands-on-title>Add the parameter parsing step</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. While in the workflow editor, add {% icon tool %} **Parse parameter value** from the list of tools:
>    - Connect the output of {% icon param-file %} **2: Expected ISCC code file** to the "Input file containing parameter to parse" input of {% icon tool %} **3: Parse parameter value**.
{: .hands_on}

### Step 3 - Add the verification step

Now we add the ISCC verification tool and connect all the inputs.

> <hands-on-title>Add the ISCC verification step</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Add {% tool [Verify ISCC-CODE](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/imgteam/iscc_sum_verify/iscc_sum_verify/0.1.0+galaxy1) %} from the list of tools:
>    - Connect the output of {% icon param-file %} **1: Input image** to the "Dataset to verify" input of {% icon tool %} **4: Verify ISCC-CODE**.
>    - Connect the output of {% icon tool %} **3: Parse parameter value** to the "File containing expected ISCC code" input of {% icon tool %} **4: Verify ISCC-CODE**.
{: .hands_on}

When placing this verification step in a full workflow, it can help validate that your processing didn't unexpectedly alter the content.

## Image analysis workflow integration

This can be applied in an image analysis workflow to verify an image processing tool provides the expected reproducible output. In the example files we shared, a thresholded image `example_thresholded1.tiff` can be found. We will use it to verify whether the Otsu threshold result of this image can be reproduced.

> <hands-on-title>Image analysis verification workflow</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Import and run the ready-to-use workflow:
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run_trs.md path="topics/imaging/tutorials/iscc-suite/workflows/ISCC---image-analysis-workflow-example.ga" title="ISCC Image Analysis Verification" %}
>
> 2. Provide the inputs:
>    - **Original image**: Select `example_image.tiff` - the image to be processed
>    - **Segmented image**: Select `example_thresholded1.tiff` - the reference segmentation to compare against
>
> 3. Run the workflow and inspect the verification output.
>
> The workflow performs Otsu thresholding on the original image and verifies whether the result matches the expected segmentation using ISCC codes. This allows you to verify whether the thresholding method is working as expected and the algorithm has not been altered (e.g., in a new version).

# Detect similar content

One of ISCC's unique features is detecting similar content, even across different formats. This is useful for finding duplicates, tracking content transformations, or identifying related files.

## Compare two files

> <hands-on-title>Compare two files for similarity</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [Find datasets with similar ISCC-CODEs](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/imgteam/iscc_sum_similarity/iscc_sum_similarity/0.1.0+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Input type"*: `Datasets to compare`
>        - {% icon param-file %} Select multiple datasets (or a collection, see below)
>    - *"Similarity threshold (Hamming distance)"*: `12` (default)
>
> 2. The tool will create tabular output which indicates which datasets are similar.
>    The table will list all the files that has been set as input. For the files which have a similar file, below the set threshold, the similar file is listed.
{: .hands_on}

## Find similar files in collections

When working with a collection of files, you can identify all similar items. This is particularly useful when you have large datasets and want to find duplicates or track how processing affects content similarity.

> <hands-on-title>Find similar files in a collection</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a dataset collection with your test images
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/collections_build_list.md %}
>
>    Include all images from the tutorial: `example_image.tiff`, `example_image2.tiff`, `example_image3.tiff` and `example_thresholded1.tiff`
>
> 2. {% tool [Find datasets with similar ISCC-CODEs](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/imgteam/iscc_sum_similarity/iscc_sum_similarity/0.1.0+galaxy1) %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"Input type"*: `Datasets to compare`
>        - {% icon param-file %} Select your collection
>    - *"Similarity threshold (Hamming distance)"*: `12` (default)
>
> 3. Examine the output table. Each row represents a file from your collection. The columns show:
>    - The filename
>    - Its ISCC code
>    - Any similar files found (with their similarity score)
>
>    Files that share content (like `example_image.tiff` and `example_image3.tiff`, which is slightly modified ) will be grouped together, although their ISCC-SUM codes are different.

![ISCC similarity table](../../images/iscc-suite/similarity_table.png)
{: .hands_on}

> <tip-title>Understanding the Hamming distance threshold</tip-title>
>
> The Hamming distance counts how many bits differ between two Data-Codes. For the default 64-bit Data-Code, this ranges from 0 (identical) to 64 (completely different). The tool uses a default threshold of 12, meaning files with a distance of 12 or less are considered similar.
>
> This threshold is a practical starting point — adjust it based on your use case: lower values for stricter matching, higher values to catch more distant similarities. Keep in mind that Data-Code similarity reflects byte-level similarity, not semantic content. Whether a given distance is scientifically meaningful depends on your domain and data.

# Practical use cases

## Use case 1: Quality control in image analysis pipelines

When processing large microscopy datasets:

- Generate ISCC codes for raw images upon acquisition
- Detect if processing steps produce consistent outputs across batch runs
- Identify accidentally duplicated samples before analysis

## Use case 2: Data deduplication and organization

When managing growing image repositories:

- Scan collections to find duplicate uploads that waste storage
- Identify images that are near-duplicates (e.g., same sample, different export settings)
- Group related experimental replicates automatically

## Use case 3: Reproducibility and data sharing

When publishing or sharing datasets:

- Include ISCC codes in data publications for recipient verification
- Document the exact input files used in published analyses
- Enable collaborators to confirm they have identical source data

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned to use the Galaxy ISCC-suite for content tracking and verification:

- **Generate ISCC-CODE**: Creates content-based identifiers for any file
- **Verify ISCC-CODE**: Confirms files match expected content at workflow checkpoints  
- **Find datasets with similar ISCC-CODEs**: Detects related or duplicate content in collections

These tools help you maintain data integrity throughout your analysis workflows, from initial data import through to final results.
