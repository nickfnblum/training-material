title: "Architecture 15 - Galaxy Production Deployment"
questions:
  - "How is Galaxy deployed in production?"
  - "What is the difference between development and production setups?"
  - "How does usegalaxy.org work?"
objectives:
  - "Understand production deployment architecture"
  - "Learn about PostgreSQL, nginx, and uWSGI"
  - "Understand multi-process and multi-host setups"
  - "Learn about usegalaxy.org infrastructure"
time_estimation: "10m"

### PostgreSQL

- Database server can scale way beyond default sqlite
- Supports concurrent connections from multiple Galaxy processes
- Better performance for production workloads
- https://www.postgresql.org/
- Configuration: `github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook` → `roles/galaxyprojectdotorg.postgresql`


---


### nginx (or Apache)

- Optimized servers for serving static content
- Reverse proxy to Galaxy application servers
- Load balancing across multiple Galaxy processes
- https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/
- https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/nginx.html#proxying-galaxy-with-nginx
- Configuration: `github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook` -> `templates/nginx/usegalaxy.j2`


---


### Webless

- Galaxy typically runs in Gunicorn - a production-grade ASGI server
- This is a great tool for both development and production but in production typically job running and workflow scheduling should happen outside a webserver
- https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#gunicorn-for-web-serving-and-webless-galaxy-applications-as-job-handlers
- https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/ansible-galaxy/tutorial.html


---


### Multi-processes

Threads in Python are limited by the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).

Running multiple processes of Galaxy and separate processes for web handling
and job processing works around this.

This used to be an important detail - but gravity + gunicorn make things a lot easier.

### Cluster Support

![Cluster Support](../../images/cluster_support.svg)

Galaxy can submit jobs to various cluster managers (Slurm, PBS, SGE, etc.)

### Complete usegalaxy.org Infrastructure

Multiple web servers, job handlers, and compute clusters working together


---


### Key Production Considerations

- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for production
- **Web Server**: Use nginx or Apache as reverse proxy
- **Processes**: Run multiple Galaxy processes
- **Job Handling**: Separate job handlers from web workers
- **Storage**: Use scalable object storage solutions
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring
- **Backups**: Regular database and file backups
