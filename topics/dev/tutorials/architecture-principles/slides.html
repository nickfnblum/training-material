## Principles

*The guiding principles of the core code architecture.*

### Aspirational Principles of Galaxy Architecture

Whereas the architecture of the frontend (Web UI) aims for consistency and is
highly opinionated, the backend (Python server) is guided by flexibility and is meant to be driven by plugins whenever possible.

???

Though an imperfect abstraction... maybe it is beneficial to think of the organizational
principles that guide frontend and backend development of Galaxy as
diametrically opposite.

The frontend architecture is guided by the principle that the end user experience
should be as simple and consistent as possible. The backend has been deployed at
so many different sites and targeting so many different technologies - that
flexibility is paramount.

---

### An Opinionated Frontend

- The target audience is a *bench scientist* - no knowledge of programming, paths, or command lines should be assumed.
- Consistent colors, fonts, themes, etc...
- Reusable components for presenting common widgets - from the generic (forms and grids) to the specific (tools and histories).
- Tied to specific technologies:
  - Implemented in JavaScript (ES6)
  - Built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for component definitions

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend

Galaxy's backend is in many ways driven by *pluggable interfaces* and
can be adapted to many different technologies.

- SQLAlchemy allows using SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (sort of) for your database.
- Many different cluster backends or job managers are supported.
- Different frontend proxies (e.g. nginx) are supported as well as web
  application containers (e.g. uWSGI, gunicorn).
- Different storage strategies and technologies are supported (e.g. S3, iRODS).
- Tool definitions, job metrics, stat middleware, tool dependency resolution, workflow modules,
  datatype definitions are all plugin driven.

???

If the chief architectural principle guiding the frontend is a fast and accessible
experience for the bench scientist, perhaps for the backend it is allowing
deployment on many different platforms and a different scales.

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend but...

Galaxy has long been guided by the principle that cloning it and calling
the `run.sh` should "just work" and should work quickly.

So by default Galaxy does not require:

 - Compilation - it fetches *binary wheels* for your platform.
 - A job manager - Galaxy can act as one.
 - An external database server - Galaxy can use an sqlite database.
 - A web proxy or external Python web server.

### In other words...

The Galaxy frontend is architected with the bench scientist in mind first and foremost,
the Galaxy backend is architected with Galaxy administrators in mind first and foremost.
