*Managing Galaxy's Python and JavaScript dependencies.*

## Dependencies

### Dependencies - Python

`script/common_startup.sh` sets up a `virtualenv` with required dependencies in `$GALAXY_ROOT/.venv` (or `$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV` if set).

- Check for existing virtual environment, if it doesn't exist check for `virtualenv`.
- If `virtualenv` exists, use it. Otherwise download it as a script and setup a virtual environment using it.
- `. "$GALAXY_VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate"`
- Upgrade to latest `pip` to allow use of binary wheels.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://wheels.galaxyproject.org/simple`
- Install dozens of dependencies.

### Dependencies - JavaScript

- Dependencies are defined in `client/package.json`.
- These are fetched from npm and compiled into bundles as part of `make client` and related `Makefile` targets.
